- ability to turn the wheel manually - while its not turning only..?
- ability to close (while clicking/holding) a relay manually..?
- write a repo readme
- give it a public url (minivac.greg.technology)
- live documentation: show relevant manual page?
- bring in examples: tic tac toe... others from all books?
- bring in existing tests or just go through books again and re-create tests: very basic "do voltage work" (like test fundamental circuit simulation), test short circuit (+ to -) at analog simulation level, then test the same at minivac level: loading a url that connects positive to negative power rails
- test the toll circuit - it should still not work - write a test for it? test it? and then see it - does the relay "alarm" sound work in the emulated circuit?
- make manual interactive: "turn on" would be hyperlinked and actually turn power on...? "push button" would do it?
- have ability to have floating greg video for specific manual examples?
- rename manual examples (file name/structure + name..?) to include book number + experiment number
- direct links to full pdf manuals + including errata (host them yourself)
- ability to push one button and then keep it pushed to push another button (... how? if clicking+holding for 3s?)
- ability to add skeuo "stickers"/"labels" ie add something "on top" of buttons 1-2-3 in elevator example? and something on top of the wheel for the elevator levels?
- deal with sound not working if not click - if loading a circuit via url and the circuit starts, relays won't be clicking. show some fake dialog?
- have an about dialog, credit William McAllister, + recurse people that helped (most recent flip flop thread + rob)
- email William McAllister
- about: i want to buy minivac + interested in the capacity + 24 additional circuit extension..!
- have links/show ads from minivac era? maybe separate sub-about page?
- present/write narrative? why do i care? why is this interesting?
- ability to have mp3 related to relays or light? for morse example (short/long beep) and for musical examples using the relays? can example labels+sounds be something "on top" of the react app state and that can be easily cleared...? how do you clear that example? can you still change circuits when an example like that is loaded?
- ability to slow down or speed up the motor wheel..?
- retest automatic toll to see if it passes (with break before make?)


### no

- can you drag a cable from one emulated minivac window to another window....???
  - (at that point, would rather have multiple minivacs in the same window and the ability to zoom out and connect them all)
- connect "external" devices: 5 relays or lights interpreted as baudot code? ability to send over the wire? or to receive? over https? show "keyboard", when typing, 5 relays are set to that? or show 5 lights... as pixels? only relevant if multiple minivacs to create mini dislpay?
