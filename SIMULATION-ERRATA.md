As found by @tmcintos, the single-input flip-flop circuit described in Book IV on pages 68-69 seems to oscillate in the simulator, and not work:

It might be a simulator issue (we'd need a real device to test it/see how it actually behaves!) - for the time being, adding it here until we can know for sure.
